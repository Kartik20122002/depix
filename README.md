You may have heard of NFT'S before . you may even know that
 NFT stand for non-fungible token .But you might not know exactly
 what that means and why this new technology is important for artist
 ,creators and businesses.

 #what does NFT means
       A fungible item is one that can be replaced by an identical
      item. Think of a dollar bill. My $1 bill has the same
     purchasing power as your $1 bill and any other $1 bill in
     circulation. In other words, they’re mutually interchangeable.

   A non-fungible item, on the other hand, is unique and can’t be
     copied or substituted. The Statue of Liberty, the Mona Lisa,
   and a ticket for a seat at the Super Bowl are all non-fungible 
     items. That is to say, they’re one-of-a-kind.

#why NFT is important
      Let’s go back to the concept of smart contracts. As I wrote
     above, a smart contract is a computer program stored on the
      blockchain that runs when certain conditions are met.
         So what kind of conditions are we talking about here 
  and how can they be used by creators and businesses?
    
     With collectible art projects, royalties can be programmed 
     into the smart contract. Typically royalties are set at 
      around 10%. This means that every time the NFT is sold,
       a percentage of that sale is programmatically sent to the 
       original creator’s wallet. This guarantees that the original 
       creators are always linked to their projects, a concept 
       called provenance, and they’ll be able to share in the upside 
       as their work becomes more well known.
       
  #About our project
      We made a website using react.js and material UI so that anyone can 
      mint a normal image to NFT and one can buy and sell NFT.
